The files in this branch can be overlaid against the trunk, but be sure to diff any files that overlap to make sure there are no differences you will miss. This should work as-is for 0.9.7 and the only overlapping file is magento.py.

The file Magento_extension/Smile/OpenERPSync/modules/Smile_OpenERPSync.xml needs to be copied to

<Magento_app_dir>/etc/modules/Smile_OpenERPSync.xml

to install the Smile/OpenERPSync module.
