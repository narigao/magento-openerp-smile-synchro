#Troubleshooting

= Magento extension test URL =
You can ensure that your Magento extension is properly installed by browsing this URL with your favorite browser:
http://localhost/magento/app/code/community/Smile_OpenERP_Synchro/openerp-synchro.php?test=true
Ensure your get a welcome message with no error before the message (there might be an error message after the welcome message but it doesn't matter).

= OpenERP error log while synchronizing =
junk after document element

you should log the detailed error message, so change temporily your xmlrpc.py library file, in     def _parse_response(self, file, sock): (close to line 1321),
add a print response statement so you get:
while 1:
            if sock:
                response = sock.recv(1024)
            else:
                response = file.read(1024)
		print response

Then stop and restart your OpenERP server, next time you get an error you might easily investigate on what is going wrong with the PHP response from Magento (you'll get the HTMK error message logged) in the OpenERP server log.


= Sale order amount precision =

If OpenERP displays order amount that seems to be trunked and differ slightly from Magento values, then you should increase the OpenERP discount field float precision inside the sale_order_line table. For instance, you can set it to the numeric(16, 4) instead of numeric(16, 2) with PGAdmin III. Warning, always make a database dump before altering it if you are running in production.


= Tax after or before discount =


= Store id =


= You imported Magento sale orders referencing products that are not in the OpenERP catalog, what to do ? =
