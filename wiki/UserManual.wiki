#summary User manual for the OpenERP/Magento connector
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Installation =
-------------

To get started you need to install both :
  * The connector module for OpenERP. Use the OpenERP module manager to load the zip file you'll find [http://code.google.com/p/magento-openerp-smile-synchro/downloads/list here]
  * The connector extension for Magento you'll install using Magento Connect Utility. The extension key is to be found on [http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/446/smile-openerp-synchro here in the Magento Connect repository ]. See installation video in flash, in the [http://code.google.com/p/magento-openerp-smile-synchro/downloads/list download section].

(Both plugins are actually bundled in the OpenERP module you can download [http://code.google.com/p/magento-openerp-smile-synchro/downloads/list here]. Both modules are also on [http://code.google.com/p/magento-openerp-smile-synchro/source/checkout SCM here ].



= Initial Configuration =
-------------

_magento interface_

You need to configure the website, shop, category, and tax class in OpenERP Client
and Magento Back office.

== _-Website_ ==

	On OpenERP, you need to configure a website Name & Url, the
	magento_id must be set to one.
	The URL must point a the base of your Magento website; usually this means http://localhost/magento/ unlike the screenshot (we will change that soon). The trailing slash is currently mandatory.

        Since 0.9.7
        You now have to configure API username and password
        That you have to create on Magento backoffice

== _-Shop_ ==

	You must configure a shop with the magento_id set to one,
	a price list and a warehouse must be defined for the shop. Ideally in the future we will map each OpenERP shop to a Magento store.

== _-Category_ ==

	Categories are now automatically exported !

== _Tax Class_ ==
	
	You can synchronize Taxes on the products : 
	When you assign taxes, such as VAT, to a product in OpenERP, you can
	also assign it a tax class id in Magento.
	Then tax class can be applied on the products in Magento.

        http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/5547/openerpscreenshot003vr5.png

	You can get the Tax class id, the same way you get the categories, 
        via SQL request: 

{{{
        SELECT 'class_id'
        FROM `tax_class`
        WHERE 'class_name'='Tax Class name"
}}}
	
	/!\ Warning
	In Magento > System > Configuration > Sales  > Tax > Calculation
	you must set :
	
        _Catalog prices include tax_, to *No*

	_Apply Tax after Discount_, to *Yes*

       http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5977/openerpscreenshot001yu2.png

== _-Discount_ ==

	To ensure discount calculation you must change the precision in your database
	(with for instance PGAdmin III) of the "discount" field, in the "sale_order" table
	you can set it to the numeric(16, 4) instead of numeric(16, 2)

        http://img112.imageshack.us/img112/7955/magentoopenerproundingmh4.png

== _-Type and Attribute_ ==

        Type and Attibute are now automatically setted to the default
        values.
        


=Category and Products synchronization=
---------------------------------------

	The "Categories" and "Product" wizards will import or/and update the
	categories and products of your OpenERP catalog to Magento Catalog.

	You can prevent a category or a product to be exported by setting the "exportable"
	field to False on a product (set on True by default).

        http://img67.imageshack.us/img67/3578/openerpscreenshot004qe1.png
        
        Added synchronize per item on products and categories.
	You can now synchronize :
		- On the main menu, all you items
		- On a tree view, the selected items
		- On a form view, the current item
	Also, when you save an item, it is automatically updated on Magento


=Sale orders synchronization=
---------------------------

== _-Import_ ==
 
	The "import" wizard will import Magento orders to OpenERP
	it will also create a partner with the customer information 
	(if he is not already known) and save his address.
	
== _-Correct_ ==
	
	In the case you import a sale order with a product defined in Magento
	and not known by OpenERP, it will be incomplete, the field "has error" will take 
	the value of 1.
	You can still correct the order by registering the product in OpenERP
	and set the Magento id in OpenERP, to the same as the one in Magento, then
	the "correct" wizard will allow you to correct sale order. 

== _-Update_ ==
	
	the "update" wizard will update the state of the order in Magento
	for the different states to draft from done.
